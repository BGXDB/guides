# Explanation for the menu


The real fun begins when u see that menu. Open it with Shift. If you use my config from the BGX Discord, open the menu with 'DELETE'.

## Core
All the plugins that BGX have are in the "Core" menu. Open it and go to 'Plugins'.

Now you will see many different Plugins. Which of them you use, is completely up to you. I will come back to that topic later.

Ask yourself the following questions: Do u want to use spells? Do u want to have drawings that show you your damage on the enemy HP Bar that u will do with your spells or more?

 - **If yes: Activate Champion Plugins.**
 -  **If no and u wanna play your champion manually: Dont activate it**


In the "Utility" tab u will find plugins like Evade, Activators and other utilitys. Things like a jungle tracker, a objective tracker and much more are very nice to have. I would suggest you to check which features are available.

In the "Core plugins" tab u will find some different predictions. You need them for Champions with skillshots. This tab is the only one u need to select first. Loading it is not enough.

To select the Prediction go to the "Core Plugins" tab.

There u need to select the prediction that you have loaded before. If u dont select it, BGX will still use the Core Prediction.
Same goes for every option you see. These plugins you always need to select.

## BGX Changer

Lets move on to the "BGX Changer". Its pretty easy to say: u can change skins. Not that much to explain. Select the skin you like the most and enjoy!

## Visuals

Disable all drawings
-
Press the hotkey and all visible drawings are disabled. Good, if you have FPS drops or dont need them.

Hide drawings in obs/discord
- 
 Pretty much self explanatory. It will hide the drawings when you're streaming and also activates a very basic fake-clicker. Not recommended to use atm.

Game visuals
-
 there u can adjust the Zoomhack to have more vision on your screen. Basically u remove the lock how far u can zoom out. Also u can see the range from enemy turrets.

Summoner Namechanger
-
You can edit your own name and names from allies or enemys. Of course its only visible for you.

BGX Banners
-
On some league events like worlds or anything, the map is edited and u have some banners on different positions. Enable it and you have BGX banners.

## Target Selector
![TS](https://i.imgur.com/6TJ8yrl.png)

Our target selector. A teamfight is happening and there are 4 different enemys infront of your face. To decide which enemy u will attack, u need to edit the mode.

Auto
-

 Trys to choose automatically the best target. Not recommended in my opinion.

Low HP
-

Attacks the target with the lowest HP currently

Most AD
-

Attacks the target who have the highest AD.

Most AP
-

Attacks the target who have the highest AP.

Closest
-

Attacks the target that is closest to your Champion.

Near Mouse
-

Attacks the target that is closest to your mouse.

 LessAttack
-
Attacks the target that needs the least Autoattacks.

LessCast
-
Attacks the target that needs the least Spellcasts.

Priority List
-

Attacks the target that have the highest priority. You can drag the enemy champions however you like it. If prio2, 4 and 5 is in range, it will attack prio2 first.

Tips
-
I always switch between "LessAttack" and "LessCast", depends on my Champion. For Ezreal for example i use LessCast, for Twitch i use LessAttack.
If your champion needs to use spells to kill the enemy (Ezreal, Zeri...) use LessCast, if your champion needs Autoattacks (Twitch, Jinx, Jax...) use LessAttack.
Always select the target that u wanna attack, thats still the best option and bypasses the settings from above. The TS cant give you the best target that exists.
